        One genre I listen to is R&B. R&B music is a genre of music that originated in the 1940s from African-Americans. It is characterized
        by smooth rhythms, blending elements of jazz, gospel, and blues in its music. One of my favorite R&B songs currently is Luther by 
        Kendrick Lamar & SZA. Another honorable mention of an R&B song that I have been listening to is Folded by Kehlani.

        Rap is a musical genre that originated and developed in the Bronx around the 1970s and involves the vocalist to deliver rapid-fire lyrics that tell a story
        through rhyme, rhythm, flow, and a consistent beat. While I do not have a favorite rap song, a few songs that I do like from the rap category are Timeless by The Weeknd,
        Dark Thoughts by Lil Tecca, and One Dance by Drake.
