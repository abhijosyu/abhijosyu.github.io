        Welcome to my website. I am Abhiram Josyula, a second year computer science student at Northeastern. I am from Walpole, Massachusetts
        which is around a 30 minute commute from here. I am currently applying for Co-ops for the Spring cycle of 2026,
        and am taking classes such as Algorithms & Structures, Intro to Data Science, Information Visualization & Presentation, and Intro to Cybersecurity.

        I have a few personal hobbies such as dance, listening to music, badminton, pickleball, and cooking. Of 
        these interests, I would say finding and listening to music is something I do the most and is an essential
        part of my day. As someone who is constantly walking around or studying, music has had a major impact
        on the quality of my day and is almost always being played whether it is through my airpods or at dance practice.
        There are numerous types of music that I listen to, ranging anywhere from rap to pop to bollywood, and this 
        site will explore some of those genres as well as my favorite songs from such genres. My favorite way to listen to music
        is from Spotify, as it has almost every song that I would listen to no matter the genre or date of the song.
